		Select to build the driver supporting the:

		Marvell Wireless Wi-Fi 88W8864 modules
		Marvell Wireless Wi-Fi 88W8897 modules

		This driver uses the kernel's mac80211 subsystem.

		If you want to compile the driver as a module (= code which can be
		inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
		say M here and read <file:Documentation/kbuild/modules.txt>.  The
		module will be called mwlwifi.

		NOTE: Selecting this driver may cause conflict with MWIFIEX driver
		that also operates on the same part number 88W8897. Users should
		select either MWIFIEX or MWLWIFI, not both. MWIFIEX is fullmac,
		supporting more comprehensive client functions for laptops/embedded
		devices. MWLWIFI is mac80211-based for full AP/Wireless Bridge.
